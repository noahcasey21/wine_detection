""" Steps: 
    0 - create a dataset of wine bottles for recognition
    1 - take in images
    2 - find individual wine bottles (if any): lots of recognition refining
    3 - determine type, brand, size, any other possible features
    4 - find that wine on the web
    4a - build a database of wines for faster retrieval?
    5 - compare
